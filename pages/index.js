          <h1> Hi, I'm Nivrithi! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
          <p> I am currently a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science. </p>
          <p> Growing up, I have always had a passion for anything involving arts and crafts and creative-problem solving, but it wasn't until my dad introduced me to programming in the beginning of high school that I discovered my love for computer science. </p>
          <p>Through my coursework at Davis, I am constantly understanding the numerous applications of CS and further exploring the intersection between technology and design. In the past,  Iâ€™ve researched and developed an algorithm to analyze & parse flight data at NASA Ames Research Center, designed and developed several new features for <a href="https://www.tadanow.com/">Tada's</a> platform,and served as both a product designer and full-stack web developer for <a href="https://linktr.ee/includedavis"> #include at Davis</a>. This summer, I will be a SWE intern for Microsoftâ€™s Azure Core Storage team.</p>
          <p>You can reach me through any of the socials below, Iâ€™d love to chat!</p>
