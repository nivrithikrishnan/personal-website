          <p> Growing up, I have always had a passion for anything involving arts and crafts and creative problem-solving, but it wasn't until my dad introduced me to programming at the beginning of high school that I discovered my love for computer science. I am always looking to further explore the numerous applications of technology its ability to challenge us to find innovative solutions to complex problems. I am especially interested in investigating the mutual shaping and intersection between society, technology and design. </p>
